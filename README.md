## Introduction

In this project, we are analyzing a dataset of recipes and ratings sourced from [](food.com), focusing on predicting cooking time based on the number of steps in a recipe. The dataset includes detailed information about recipes, such as preparation time and user-generated tags, alongside user ratings and reviews. This subset of data spans recipes and reviews submitted since 2008, offering a large foundation for analysis.

Our approach begins with cleaning the dataset and conducting exploratory data analysis to understand the relationship between recipe attributes and cooking time. We will also analyze potential patterns and correlations between the number of steps and preparation time across a variety of recipe types.

Our research question is: 

**How accurately can we predict cooking time based on the number of steps in a recipe?**

Using this investigation, we aim to build a predictive model that helps streamline recipe planning for users by providing accurate cooking time estimates. This insight could enhance recipe recommendation systems, improving user experience by tailoring recommendations to their time constraints and preferences.
